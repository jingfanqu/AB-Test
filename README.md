# AB-Test

- Conducted an A/B test analysis using a dataset of user engagement (cookie_cats.csv) to evaluate the impact of level design changes on player retention in the mobile game "Cookie Cats".
- Designed the experiment framework in Python, defining control and test groups to ensure statistically significant results.
- Implemented data preprocessing and hypothesis testing within a Jupyter Notebook environment, analyzing player behavior before and after exposure to new game levels.
- Utilized Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and SciPy for statistical analysis to determine the effect of the changes on 7-day retention rates.
- Compiled findings into a comprehensive report, outlining recommendations for level adjustments that resulted in a demonstrable increase in user retention and playtime.
